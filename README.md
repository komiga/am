## What is this?

**All the Mathsâ€½ (AM)** is a general-purpose mathematics C++11 header library
which supplies:

* Vectors (yay!) and matrices (also yay!) and all the fancy operations on them
  that you'd expect from a maths lib.
* Hashing algorithms.
* *(A whole bunch of other stuff.)*

It's, uh, a work-in-progress.

If you want a proper graphics maths lib that works with crappy compilers,
please use the lovely [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/).

## *All* the maths, you say?

Hence the interrobang.

## Why?

Because I can.

## Building

Being a header library, AM is not compiled directly. However, all features
support Clang 3.3+ with libc++ (SVN head). GCC with libstdc++ is only partially
supported (as of 4.7.3) due to issues in ISO compliance (see *Defects* below).

The tests can be compiled using
my [standard project protocol](http://komiga.com/pp-cpp).

## Defects

The following features cannot be used in GCC (4.7.3):

1. GCC fails to compile a pointer arithmetic expression in the constexpr
   implementation for murmur3 (`<am/hash/murmur.hpp>`, implementation at
   `<am/hash/detail/hash/murmur_impl.hpp>` -- specifically, `calc_c_seq()`).

## License

**AM** carries the MIT license, which is gracefully plastered below. Some
algorithms have separate (MIT-compatible) licenses, copyrights, or are in the
public domain. These are indicated in the appropriate sections.
