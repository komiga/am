@defgroup linear Linear algebra
@details

Everything in this module is mostly designed to be compatible with
GLSL (4.20.8). That means all built-in operators, except for matrix-matrix and
matrix-vector division and multiplication (which are the proper linear algebraic
calculations), are component-wise.
